    "## Why Use NumPy?\n",
    "\n",
    "- In Python we have lists that serve the purpose of arrays, but they are slow to process.\n",
    "\n",
    "- NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than traditional Python lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The array object in NumPy is called ndarray, it provides a lot of supporting functions that make working with ndarray very easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Arrays are very frequently used in data science, where speed and resources are very important."

    "## Why is NumPy Faster Than Lists?\n",
    "\n",
    "- NumPy arrays are stored at one continuous place in memory unlike lists, so processes can access and manipulate them very efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This behavior is called locality of reference in computer science.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This is the main reason why NumPy is faster than lists. Also it is optimized to work with latest CPU architectures.\n",
